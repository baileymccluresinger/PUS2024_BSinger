# Repository Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to submit my work for SPPA720 Homework #2 
# HW2 Purpose
The purpose of Assignment 1 is to ensure that we are able to call functions related to descriptive statistics, create appropriate visuals, and provide baseline analysis of the summary statistics for the distribution.
The purpose of Assignment 2 is to design a falsifiable experiment (null hypothesis, alternative hypothesis, hypothesis testing, etc.) based on the data provided.
# Aside
For Assignment 2, I think I may have attempted more steps than was prescribed for the homework. I began working over the weekend but after Tuesday's class, I stopped. Also, I originally assumed that one factor in my categorical data had to be gender, but if my experimental design is too similar to the example, I can change it.

[I worked by myself for these assignments]
